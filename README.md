# My challenges with this project:
- I chose to make a task-list as a project because I already made one of these using JavaScrip and I would like to get to know the differences of a React App with the same functionalities.

# What I've learned:
- props to pass data from a parent component to a child component
- consuming data from an API
- useEffect to executes a block of code whenever a variable changes. In this case, to consume API data when website loads
```
  useEffect(() => {
      const fetchTasks = async () => {
      const {data} = await axios.get("https://jsonplaceholder.cypress.io/todos?_limit=10")
      setTasks(data)
    }
    fetchTasks()
  }, [])
 
```
